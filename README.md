```
    $ terraform init                    ( This will intialize the plugins needed for the code ) 
    $ terraform plan                    ( This will show what it's going to create/update/delete the infra based on the code vs what we have on the cloud )
    $ terraform apply -auto-approve     ( This is going to apply the changes shown on the plan, if applied immediately )
